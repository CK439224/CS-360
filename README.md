### **Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**
  - For this term project we had to pick between three different apps to create. The three choices were: an inventory app, event-tracking app, or weight-tracking app. I decided to go with the event-tracking app. As part of the scope of the project, I had to create a working app that had specific requirements. The requirements that must have included the following features: 
    - A database with at least two tables, one to store the inventory items and one to store user logins and passwords
    - A screen for logging into the app (Note that the screen for logging into the app should also be used to create a login if the user has never logged in before.)
    - A screen with a grid that displays all items in the inventory
    - A mechanism by which the user can add and remove items from the inventory
    - A mechanism by which the user can increase or decrease the number of a specific item in the inventory
    - A mechanism by which the application will notify the user when the amount of any item in the inventory has been reduced to zero


### **What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**
  - There were multiple screens that were required to complete this app such as: A login screen that would allow a new user to create an account or allow an existing user to sign in. An event listing screen that showed all existing events that were previously entered. An event creation pop-up screen that would allow the user to enter a description, date, time, and how long before the event they wanted a reminder. I tried to make the UI designs as simple as possible to reduce any confusion as to how the app works and what needed to be completed in order to enter events. I believe I was successful in doing so. 

### **How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?**
  - When designing software, I take a systematic approach. A big part of this is reviewing all documents that have information pertaining to what the system should do and look like. I take notes on every item that needs to be include and ensure that these needs are met. I make sure I have a clear understanding of what is wanted and if there is anything that Iâ€™m not sure on, I ask questions to clear them up. Then I break the project up into more manageable parts.

### **How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?**
  - In order to test the functionality of my app I ran through all potential scenarios that I could think of. Since this was a base level app, I did not program in too many specific requirements for the user to follow which reduced my testing timeline. Once I had a functioning base app, I made sure to test each element that I added to my code to ensure that it was working properly, this allowed me to catch bugs early on and reduced my troubleshooting time since I knew what code I had just added. 

### **Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**
  - I struggled mostly with the placement of my items in my app. I had to constantly refer to notes and look up different solutions online. For the most part, I utilized guess, test, and revise in a way. I would make changes to the layout and fiddle with each item until I got it how I wanted, then I would move on to the next item.

### **In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**
  - I believe that the login and user registration screen is where I was particularly successful. I was able to create this portion pretty quickly and easily with little to no trouble. I struggled more with the event listing and creation portion.
